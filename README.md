Teapot is a static binary rewriting & dynamic fuzzing based Spectre gadget detector,

This repository contains the Teapot binary rewriter. 
The submodule `libcheckpoint_x64` contains the runtime library.

Teapot was codenamed NaHCO3 in its development.
We are currently in the process of migrating the code to match the names described in the paper.
