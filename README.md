# Teapot

Teapot is a static binary rewriting & dynamic fuzzing based Spectre gadget detector, 
described in the paper "Efficiently Uncovering Spectre Gadgets in COTS Binaries with Speculation Shadows" (under review).

This repository contains the Teapot binary rewriter. 
The submodule `libcheckpoint_x64` contains the runtime library.

## Notes on naming

Teapot was codenamed NaHCO3 in its development.
We are currently in the process of migrating the code to match the names described in the paper.
